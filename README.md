# Mapty

## What is this?

This is a project I made to apply OOP and geolocation in modern JS (ES6+).

It was based on the lectures of "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann

## Is it hosted somewhere?

Sure, right [here](https://mfigueira.github.io/mapty/).
